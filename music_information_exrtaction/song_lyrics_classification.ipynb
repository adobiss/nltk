You were freezing over hell, You were bringing on the end you do so well You can only blame yourself, that's what I say All that you've taught is to ignore the things I was showing And sweep me under the rug, You're beating with a book everyone that book tells you to love, There is an ember in the heart of the kiln and its burning hot with love, Burning out my center till there's nothing but dust, Rolling me with care into your cigarette, Cause the God I believe in never worked on a campaign trail. What did you learn tonight? Shouting so loud you barely see, You're this broken thing, You're a voice that never sings, that's what I say.
